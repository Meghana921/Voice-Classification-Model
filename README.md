#Speech-recognition
Voice classification using ML The primary objective of SER is to improve man-machine interface. It can also be used to monitor the psycho physiological state of a person in lie detectors. In recent time, speech emotion recognition also find its applications in medicine and forensics.

To implement a real-time classification algorithm for inferring emotions from the non-verbal features of speech. It is expected to successfully extract a set of features and use them to train and detect emotions from speech. As an optional extension, the emotion detector will be applied to perform speech quality assessment.

The underlying theory of machine learning requires an understanding of mathematics in machine learning and optimisation not formally covered in the Computer Science Tripos. A significant amount of time would be devoted to acquire this background knowledge

The key challenge, in emotion detection and in pattern recognition in general, is to maximise the between-class variability whilst minimising the withinclass variability so that classes are well separated. However, features indicating different emotional states may be overlapping, and there may be multiple ways of expressing the same emotional state.

One strategy is to compute as many features as possible. Optimisation algorithms can then be applied to select the features contributing most to the discrimination while ignoring others, creating a compact emotion code that can be used for classification. This avoids making difficult a priori assumptions about which features may be relevant.
